# My Old Site Layout (2024)

This repository contains the original version of my portfolio site, created in late 2024 when I was first getting back into coding.

## 📘 About

At the time, I was following tutorials and working through books to rebuild my web development skills. This layout represents my early effort at creating a complete website, even if I didn’t fully know what I was doing yet.

It’s not perfect (in fact, it’s kind of bad and junky 😅), but I’m keeping it here as a personal milestone and learning reference.

- HTML  
- CSS
